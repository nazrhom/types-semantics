Everything has been correctly implemented, the proposed solutions are often very close to the ones provided and in 
general are very elegant.
The only problem I encountered was the handling of the recursive calls in some of the proofs. This problem was 
correctly identified by the student and acknowledged 
in the comments.

The grading is full points everywhere, with a subtraction of  0.5 for the aforementioned issue. 
(Can also be thought as two subtractions of 0.25: one from the soundness and completeness of big step semantics and the 
other from the extension of proofs to pairs, since this is where the problem hit the most).

An additional 0.25 points are earned from the definition of a map function used to map the correct constructor over a 
list of steps. This general function avoids a lot of boilerplate code that is instead present in the provided solution.

Grade: 8.75/9
