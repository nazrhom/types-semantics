To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
    -- (0.5) Examples cover the basics
    -- (0.5) Documentation for base analysis is comprehensive
    -- (2) Some of the poisoning is not correctly dealt with, but in 

(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0.3) Working examples only cover very basic cases
  -- (0.4) Constraints could have been explained in more detail
  -- (1) The implementation does not appear to be complete, constraints are not properly 
  dealt with in this case and some of the examples are not parsable.

(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0) Not there
  -- (0.4) Constraints could have been explained in more detail
  -- (0) Not there

(iv)  1   point or less
  -- (0) not implemented

   
General readability of the pdf and the code: 1 point or less
  -- (0.6) The code is sufficently readable, there are however some choices
  in the implementation i.e. the generation of fresh variables, that can be 
  improved. The pdf goes into a lot of details about the basic analysis but 
  information about the extensions is a bit lacking

Issues to think of: 
  * do examples cover important cases, like list of functions, functions on
    pairs?
  * is subeffecting done in a way that tries to prevent poisoning? You can
    usually tell from the unification rule for functions (equating the
    annotation variables in that case usually means that active measures
    against poisoning were not taken).
  * Is the flow of the case statements done well?
  * does the documentation provide the necessary type rules and explanations
  * maybe it goes without saying, but if some part is partially answered,
    you should estimate the percentage that was done correctly.
    
Bonuspoint: 
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  - if yes, give up to one point (dont forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)



Score for:
(i)        : 3.0
